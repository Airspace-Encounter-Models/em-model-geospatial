# Data

Directories to store geospatial datasets.

## Default Datasets

The following datasets have been used to generate representative trajectories:

## Other Datasets

The following datasets were identified for potential use in developing representative trajectories. The can potentially be leveraged with this open source code but they are not default nor developmental datasets.
