# USGS-United States Wind Turbine Database (USWTDB)

The United States Wind Turbine Database (USWTDB) provides the locations of land-based and offshore wind turbines in the United States, corresponding wind project information, and turbine technical specifications. Wind turbine records are collected and compiled from various public and private sources, digitized and position-verified from aerial imagery, and quality checked. The January 2020 release includes data on 63,003 turbines covering 43 states (plus Guam and PR). The most recent turbines added to the USWTDB became operational as recently as the third quarter of 2019, with a few from the fourth quarter 2019. The oldest turbines in the data set were installed prior to 1990.
